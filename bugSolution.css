The solution involves using the `text-overflow` property (in conjunction with `overflow: hidden;` and `white-space: nowrap;`) to handle the overflow gracefully:

```css
.container {
  width: 100px;
  overflow: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

.container::before {
  content: "This is a very long string that may overflow its container.";
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

Alternatively, you can shorten the content of the pseudo-element or break it into multiple lines using line breaks within the content string.
